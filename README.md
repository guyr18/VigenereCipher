# VigenereCipher
Vigenere Cipher is an encryption algorithm; more information can be found in https://github.com/guyr18/VigenereCipher/blob/main/HWK3.pdf  

# Running This Application
This algorithm is implemented in Python 3.x; Furthermore, it requires two arguments as input and can be run via the command line
as follows:

    python3 core.py -kw=WHITE -msg=divert troops to east ridge
    
Command line argument validation is not implemented. If you fail to provide a delimiter with your argument name, this application
may return an exception. It is recommended to use the -kw and -msg flags as provided;

-kw => Keyword Phrase  
-msg => Message to be encrypted  

These input components are extensively discussed in the before-mentioned link.
